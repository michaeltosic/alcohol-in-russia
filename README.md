# Analysis of regional alcohol sales in Russia (1998-2016)
This projects consists of a Jupyter notebook containing code for a basic analysis of the alcohol sales and demography data in Russia. The different types of alcohol as well as regional differences are analyzed.

## Installation
Anaconda distribution:
Python 3.9.7
jupyter notebook 6.4.5

Additonal packages:
plotly 5.5.0

## Motivation
This project work is part of my online course on data science. I chose to find new datasets rather than to work with the suggested ones and since I am interested in Russian culture as well as cocktails :), I chose to take a look on the alcohol sales per capita in Russia over the years and use this for my analysis.

### Mini-Disclaimer
I am very much a beginner in data analysis and have create this as one of my projects in an online course. Please don't take the conclusions I have made too seriously. If you have suggestions for improvement please feel free to let me know.
